# JSweather
I have created a simple JavaScript weather application in this project. With the help of an API, this application retrieves the weather data for the entered city and changes the background image and icon based on the weather condition. Since this application is just an example, it needs further development. More images can be added, or more detailed information can be retrieved. You can build upon this example to create more advanced versions.
